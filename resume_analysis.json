    "score_justification": "The resume demonstrates a solid foundation in marketing with relevant experience that aligns with many of the job requirements. The candidate's background in digital marketing, content creation, and data analysis is particularly strong. However, the resume could be more tailored to the specific needs of XYZ Corporation and the Senior Marketing Specialist role. It lacks emphasis on some key areas such as brand management, project management, and the company's focus on innovation. With these improvements, the resume would more closely match the job requirements and reflect the company culture. The current resume provides a good starting point but requires significant tailoring to fully meet the needs of this specific application.",
